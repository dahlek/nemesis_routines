Python scripts I frequently use to analyze the results of NEMESIS runs.

mre_reader.py - plots measured spectra and error, and fitted synthetic spectrum, as reported by the *.mre file.

aerosol_reader.py - plots the aerosol profile(s) from aerosol.prf

nem_CB_wrapper.py - calls various NEMESIS routines to develop Creme Brulee models
